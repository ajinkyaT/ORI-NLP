Whenever buying an AC check for EER (Energy Efficient Ratio) which should be at-least 4.0 or above for high power savings. This is most recent and rare model I found on the Internet.After lots of research for my first Split AC. I found this great machine.Price: Costly.Power Efficient: Yes 4.3 EER.Looks: Sexy & Damn the digital Display is just elegant.The Remote shows its WiFi AC, can be controlled using a smart app but I didn't find any details on the Manuals or Website. But Bluestar is working on it as shared by Bluestar Installation Guy.Things to Note:Upgrading from Window to Split is lot of hassles & extra money.Window AC are very easy to Install with no extra cost.I bought this in Summer Season as there was an offer from Bluestar for Free Installation.Now, if you purchase, You will have to shed out Rs.1200/ for Installation. + If any Copper Coil or Insulation Tape or Stand or anything required extra with this.Bluestar outer model is very large even for 1.5 ton AC compared to other Split AC's. Make sure you have an extra space for placing the Outdoor Fan Cabinet.Anyways, I was not happy with Seller's Communication as I wanted to speak with him over the phone but he stick to Email Replies passing through Amazon as midator which took more time to get answers.",Good Product!!!,Good,Mast,i bought this product in nagpur...awesome cooling and energy efficient...good one,,,,4,3,3,10,1.0,0.0,0.0

But the colling rate it provide is super. It can condense a 159 sq feet room in just 3 min at 25 c. Happy with the product. It is super silent. Silent than a normal fan. I was going to purchase z series ac but it has all features of it and less expensive. Remote is another cool feature. It is performed by wifi. U doest want to aim at the ac for control. U can control it frm anywhere in room. Coolest looking remoteVery happy and u should go with it. Their service is also good. Better than godreg,"This the best ac u can get in this price, I bought it from local store at the same price with stabilizer include, it is comes with copper coil and blue fin which is very helpful for your money.No Corrosion. And it will looks very classy in your room.",,,,,,4,3,3,10,1.0,0.0,0.0

I have shortlisted Daikin, Carrier, Hitachi, O General and Mitsubishi only, as i want Full Copper Condenser unlike aluminium condenser in LG, Samsung, Voltas or Bluestar. Because of Copper Condenser, the cooling is very fast and effective. Also, looks wise as well as performance wise, the product is excellent. In terms of noise, Daikin ACs are the best though it is still comparable with Hitachi and much better than LG/Samsung/Voltas.Only issue I faced was with Installation, which took time and I have to pay Rs 1500 for installation and Rs 2000 for extra Copper pipe.","Amazing delivery by Amazon and ATS team. About the product it is good in terms of performance, long term usage especially during summer remains to be verified. Two things which have reduced the rating:a) The out door unit doesn't have a protection plastic cap or cover over the copper pipe inlets. This is strange as the unit has holes to fix the cover but no cover. The installation team confirmed that carrier doesn't provide the cover, this is unacceptable considering the cover is a basic small cost item and even the unbranded air conditioners provide the same.b) Installation team was competent , fast and clean, however they haven't yet sent the installation report or the invoice for the installation charges paid. Maybe some genuine issues , however the same still remains outstanding inspite of calls to the local Carrier office.",I purchase rs.35250.(3 month ago) Carrier 1.5 ton 5 star superior model it is a very good and nice cooling. display LED.. silent .

So think before you buy a Carrier AC or be ready to be at there mercy. Don't even feel like giving 1 star.,I have gone through almost a hundred reviews today.. Dropped to buy Voltas as well as carrier. Why does amazon write installation as 1500 to 2000.  None of the reviews give this figure. Most of them have said it costed 2500. Some said they had to pay for extra wire as the wire was too short.,"Product was delivered salfely in time as promised.

Kindly vote if this review is helpful,"I didn't buy this AC from Amazon though, but its a great AC. I bought the same but, 3 star AC, a month ago.This is my first Carrier product.The cooling is really superb.The noise level is tolerable(not very loud).So for performance i'll give it 5 on 5.The only bad thing about it is the Remote. Its a bit old fashioned and has no screen on it. It doesn't even come with a wall mounting stand/holder.At night, you wouldn't see the buttons of the remote at all and its super small.But anyways, I would recommend buying this AC.",Good product,"Though not purchased the product from Amazon, overall excellent product.

It cools my 12x12 room pretty quickly with in 5 to 6 minutes.Installation:Installation from Carrier folks is OK if not good/excellent. But in this HOT demanding Summer probably I would not expect much more from these AC companies. Be sure to purchase a Stabilizer as well if you are purchasing the AC online. Because, carrier folks when they come for installation, they do not bring or sell any additional stuff (like stand for ODU, power chord, copper wire or stabilizer) And they charged 1500 for installation.Product:Almost all the sites, this particular product is shown with a flower design on the Indoor Unit. However, the one I got did not have. Checked on carrier website, it appears that ACs made this year this flower design is not there for OCTRA model. Cooling wise it is very good so far. Cools my 12 by 12 root pretty quickly in 6 to 7 minutes.Overall I am happy with the unit. Probably after using it for a while I can post another update.",,,,,,,,1,3,1,7,1.0,0.0,0.0

I have done some research on this before making the decision. This is one of the least power consuming air conditioners in the country. The power consumption is 650 watts and the Inverter technology used in this is tier 2. Basic inverter is FTKP series which is priced below this one. The Machine is silent and cooling is fast.

It was delivered very promptly and installed it on the top floor of the building. Unaware of the intricacies of ac installation and lack of advice from the generic ac installer I let them install the usual way on the sunshade with brackets. The noise from the outdoor unit kept us awake most of the night with the compressor kicking in and out struggling with the extreme temperatures. This started an on going email issue with Electroluxs customer service for almost 2 months. My point being that it was the installer/ company's primary duty to customer to recommend that the top floor installation be on the inside parapet wall on the door side to quieten the noise. Finally good business sense expected from a company of electrolux caliber prevailed and they reinstalled the acs. An avoidable effort had this recommendation been proffered in the first instance. My suggestion to Drill an additional hole to reroute the conduit to avoid unsightly over the wall placement as done now was over ruled by the latest installer under the excuse that the efficiency would be affected by too many bends of the conduit. The same one extra bend now used to relocate. May be he was not keen to go through the extra effort of drilling a 4 inch hole?I want to share my experience so companies and other customers install acs on the top most floor of the buildings on the roof side. THis in my case did bring down the noise level in the rooms by a whole 10 decibels to a whisper quiet level. Thanks to Electroluxs decision to give primacy to customer satisfaction over a few rupees and thus build loyalty.","Its a good buy and a 5 star rating at a cheaper rate. Something I liked very much is and helpful to all reading this review ; the copper pipes to the indoor unit enters it from back so U dont need to make any special arrangements to hide it unlike an LG split ac in my residence in which the copper pipes enter the machine from side and it looks shabby. The performance is good and the magic I liked it, the ac runs and u can switch off the display. so that the room remains dark. Standard installation charges are around 1700 rupees which are fair enough.","I have total more than 20 ACs in my 2 home and clinic.I have came across almost all brands.Among them Electrolux , I find very reasonably priced and perfect.Though I have 7 Daikin AC , but never buy it, very pathetic after sale service.Carrier is also good brand and also good after sales.","Have bought it from somewhere else, but have to say that this is the best ac one can get under 30k.U get get everything u need like1.5 ton cooling.Copper condenser(personally checked)Bigger outdoor unit5 star rating(only Electrolux provides it in this price)Little bit noisy but i think one can adjust thatAlso in my case the installation guy came the next day after the arrival.","Good cooling. Looks nice and elegant. Fast shipping by seller.Installation done within 24 hours by Electrolux. Was unhappy with the additional installation charges which were Rs.1500+taxes+Rs.750 for outside wall brackets. All in all around Rs.2500.Would have prefered to pay 'Cash on delivery', but the option was not available.",Electrolux Service is not Good...No one is coming for installation... Electrolux Service Engineer Name Kapil from Goa is a big lier...He knows to only cheat customers by saying he will be coming...But thing is he is not coming atall...Finally After seeing for 10 days I called Local Engineer for installation but unfortunately AC is not Working and there is no support from Electrolux,"I purchased from a local dealer,cooling is very effective,,nice product,,,,,,,cheap and best in india,,,,,",Very good product for reasonable price. All Cooper condenser tubing guarantee longer life and comparable bigger outer unit ensure faster cooling in lesser time. Performance of AC also depends on installation. Prompt and genuine installation service provided. Installer were knowledgeable and responsible person. I thanks Electrolux company for providing this product. It gives peace of mind and satisfaction.,2,2,3,3,4.0,0.0,0.0

All they say is ""The complaint is about a different department. We will arrange a callback."" THE CALLBACK NEVER HAPPENS. It was only after spending hours calling for support and being tossed around to different executives did I get the mandatory dry service after abt 20 days.3. The products are sub standard. The remote control for AC stopped working within 6 months with very minimal use. It was not dropped or had any external damage. It just stopped working on its own and I had to buy a new one.4. The call centre support is horrible. When the remote went bad i tried calling the toll free number. For 1 hr 02 seconds i was holding the call just listening to the tape ""Your Call is important to us. Our Executive will attend you shortly.""!!5. Their sales team is a pain in the neck!

What's the use of Iclean feature if basic ac is not working properly.,Bad quality. The worst customer care ever. Took 2 weeks to come for installation even though it was paid. Leaked the gas due to installation mistakes. Then took 1 month to accept and come for its repair. Did not repair and took another 1 month to come again. Still not repaired. Rude customer care and very unhelpful.,Worst possible Service Center anyone would have encountered ever. No installation support and Amazon is as helpless as it can get. Amazon should not sell products for companies like Hitachi - since this ends up in a bad review for both.Very strongly recommend to stay away from Hitachi.,"We have been using this ac for just one day. So, I can't really comment on reliability of the ac. But, the out of the box performance of the ac is pretty good. Basic cooling functionality seems to be quite decent even for a fairly large room of 10ft by 25ft.I was scared of the installation bungles after reading majority of the 1 star reviews.

Compressor switches on pretty soon to experience cool air almost instantly(within less than a minute).+ I have 3 hitachi A/Cs at home and they have been running without any issues ( I haven't even put AMC trusting on the ACs ).- Expect to spend atleast around 6,000-8,000 INR more after you purchase this A/C for getting the stabilizer and the installations.* I ordered the AC at Amazon for ~43,000 INR ( I got 5,000 INR as gift card, so, eventually, I am paying only 38,000 INR ). Awesome ordering experience from Amazon.* Note that the AC doesn't come with stabilizer. So, I need to spend ~3.6k for the stabilizer ( bought it from an offline store ).* The installation is not free of cost. The cost of installation varies primarily with the distance of the 'outdoor unit' from the place where you fit the A/C inside the room. Overall, I spent close to 4,000 INR for the installation ( including the materials ).Summary, I spent 43K-5K+3.6K+4K = 45.6K for getting the AC completely installed at my home. I still believe this is a good deal from Amazon, but I hadn't gone out to dealers to verify.One more thing. The Seller was Viveks. The seller was very very prompt, he called me to provide regular updates and even shipped the product the next day itself!I am reducing one star because of the following: Amazon.in website said that it couldn't ship the item to my home(600096).

Although the hitachi support people replaced the broken flap and re-connected the electrical part later after reporting to them repeatedly, we are yet to hear from their side on demo and resolution of the damaged fins. After few days of operation, the sound of the motor inside AC has increased which defeats the company's self proclaimed statement that it operates very SILENTLY.Request the MD,CEO,CIO,GMs, stake-holders of hitachi to take note ' and provide prompt resolution.2. The fins on the backside of ac were damaged in many places & informed to hitachi official but they ignored the complaint.","I bought it this ac abd its been delivered damaged, when I complaint about it than Hitachi dealer said that there no problem in coolling whether its damaged and they have not replaced therefore I started facing bcoz its creates lots of noise apart from that its cooling good even I set the temp 24. I logged a complaint in Hitachi service center however unprofessional technician visited my place but thay are not able to resolve the issue, I requested them to replace it but they don't even listen you and close the case. Guys this is pathetic ac and worst service provided by Hitachi, please don't buy it else you will buy headech.","Piece of junk metal. I'll never buy any Hitachi product again.I bought this product because I wanted a quiet AC and this had the lowest noise level specifications. Big mistake. It would put a cheap farm tractor to shame. I believe this is a design flaw as I saw a lot of reviews complaining about the same but the old reviews seem to have disappeared from all ecommerce sites now. It also sometimes makes a different gasping sound as if it is about to die of a sudden stroke or fall out of the window.Most important, it doesn't seem to be capable of handling Indian summers. My other airconditioners of other brands are far more efficient and are cheaper and more reliable.Hitachi service is as pathetic as the products are. The call centre is nearly impossible to contact. Either the number is busy and I once managed to reach the IVR, it did not accept any key presses. I had to finally get the number of my local service centre from someone. Another nightmare experience.It's been 12 days since my AC broke down. 3 days since it was finally picked up. It's past working hours and the service centre disconnected my call at 5:45 pm. Pathetic!!!","So far looking good to me. Cooling is nice, Noise level is considerably good comparing to my previous Carrier A/c. Let me check on the power consumption and update my review after few months.

Even on Hitachi site no response is given, Think twice before buying.","Please be careful if you are looking for a Hitachi A/C. It is not just their service that has quality issues but their products also are not reliable. Think twice before spending on Hitachi. I bought this model a/c 4 years ago and it is having only issues. All the frills stopped working in few months like dust sensors, swing,etc. And the the cooling started detonating. It is not able to cool 100sft room.The current problem is fins freezes and forms ice as in the picture and the A/C start blowing hot air.

Anyway, since I'm optimistic and in India sometimes even paying extra the service and products might betray here goes - The AC is beautiful and looks much better than it appears on the photo. The noise is unbelievably low. I was more concerned about the sound levels of the outdoor unit as I did not want to disturb my neighbours and this AC has delivered!!! Needless to say the indoor unit is super silent as well. Installation guys came in less than 24 hours and were so pleasant. The whole experience was a breeze. Well done Amazon and Hitachi!",Absolutely perfect product for a 120 Sq ft room. Cool fast. Amazon Rocks with their service and the price in which it was delivered.. Have been using since only 2 days but until now all good . Product was very well packed and delivered on time. Hitachi Installation was absolute bang on. Overall everything was just perfect and as i wanted. No complaints.,I faced a lot of problem with AC Installation. I called Hitachi helpline number multiple time but they didn't picked up the call at all. I have to write lot of mails to amazon and Hitachi to get the work done.  Installation team was very rude and unprofessional and misguided us to have a drill on concrete and charges extra amount of money. Water outlet pipe was not given with the box (most others companies give the pipe) Instillation team forced us to purchase 12 feet pipe at 40 rupees (40*12=480 rupees) per feet cost (While market rate is just 100 rupees only). In short they are making a unprofessional business out of installation. Noise of the outdoor unit is very high (If you are living in an apartment then there may not be a severe problem but for individual houses it may be irritating.),I think there is a need of sale for Hitachi products we are not getting quite good discount on AC please consider it. I mean not to compare store and websites. But to give what customer really wantThe discounts may only cover the price of installation so need to increase it.,Indoor unit is very noisy not expected from split ac.

This is the 4th Hitachi AC for me, and once aGain i'm happy to report that this 5 star self cleaning all white split unit is a gem of a machine. Time will tell if this piece gives me as much peace of mind as my other ones.. Hitachi customer service has gotten better over the years as well. Cloudtail is the best seller for such items, & as usual i had a flawless experience. Installation is done by the compnay guys, within 2 days of you calling them.I suggest you call them 2 days before the scheduled delivery date so that the delivery and isntallation can happen in one day itself. If AC installation is not a new thing to you, & if your wall does not have an ac pipe outlet from before, then I would also suggest getting your local guy to make a hole in the wall about 3-4 sq inches  to allow for the drain pipes, the coolant pipes and the connection wire to pass thru between the indoor and outdoor unit. Also think about the electric connection for the ac, how far it is from the AC, the need for a stabilizer &/or an isolation ELCB, etc.In short, the more you're prepared, the better and easier it will be , with fewer surprises.Of course, if you've got people to take care of these things, then you probably wont read this bit anyway. Its a good model, go for it.One minor gripe, the remote for this does not come with a wall cradle.. :/ those were quite handy!","I have been searching and searching for a quality 1.2 Ton, 5 Energy Star rated AC and couldn't find anything below 35k.Luckily, Hitachi's RAU514IVD appeared on Amazon out of nowhere at a very tempting price and I had to take a leap of faith. The AC was delivered on exactly the date and the time-slot I chose, which was pretty awesome.Re: Installation, apparently, the third-party Hitachi affiliated service folks are nearby my area itself, so it took them not more than 24 hours to send the technician for the installation. Took a while,4 hours or something to get everything up and running. It's been working flawlessly.NOTE : Installation for the AC was free for me, but doesn't apply to all the areas.P.S. NOTE: I brought the AC stand and Stabilizer from Hitachi itself, they have a tie up with a company in India called ""Ryoku"" or something. Quality stuff, but a bit pricey.Overall, I am loving it! Thank you Amazon.",Excellent product. Best cooling effect. iClean is a wonderful feature. Go for it you will never regret. Amazon has given the best price. Retail shops are not even imagine that price.,it gives chilled cooling & very very silent AC,,,,,7,20,5,15,2.0,1.0,0.0

After 4-5 phone calls and writing mails, finally the engineer came to my house, he told me that a part is broken from inside and also indicated that the guy who came for service must have done this. So it was not my fault. But now Hitachi is not doing anything for me. I have realized that Hitachi's service is the worst.

I am posting after using the Hyundai HSP53.GO1-QGE Split AC 1.5 Ton, 3Star product for few days now.. First of all in this Budget you will never get 1.5 ton ac in market. Ac works perfect and cooling is very nice.. NOw Technical part.. Outdour condensor is Microchannel Aluminum Coil.. Compressor Is GMCC (Toshiba Make ) Part no PH300G2C-4ku1. With 55MFD capacitor manufactured by SYSCAP. Outbody is good quality Well build. Now Indore Unit : Look is Good and Plastic Part is made of average Quality. Only Basic Function available with ac. Some of False function described by Amazon. as follows.NO Blower Function, No 4 way swing only Vertical so this 2 Way., No room Temperature Display as it show only ac temperature. Hope this help you.Thanks Manoj","Outdoor unit makes lot of noise, very very poor quality plastic all over (This is not my first AC but 3rd one).I would not recommend this to anyone!","Worst  ac possible....... i bought  this  hyundai 1.5 ton  ac on  5/10/2016. I received  a damaged peice  but didn't  know this, so got it installed  10 days back...... but there was no gas,  so i launched  a complaint.  They came after 2 days for inspection  and confirmed  that gas was leaked, after 2 days their machanic  came  and he welded a join  further damaging  the ac, and paint was burnt-out.  Now why should  i keep a new brand ac  that was yet not started and damaged. I demande replacement  of it..... but they are refusing  any replacement. Giys please  be  careful...... this can happen to you also..... i am suffering  after spending money and still without ac.",The AC came with No Gas and did not get cold. I had to pass through lots of hassle before gas was filled and it started working. I really dont where all the gas disappeared and how long the filled gas will last. I also dont know the reason for there being no gas in the brand new AC,I bought 1 tonn AC of Hyundai. I got the delivery a day before scheduled date. I got it installed from a outside technician same day as charges were same. Next day got call from company for installation. Performace wise fully satisfied. Colls the room well. No less than any other AC in terms of cooling.,"Execellent product with reasonable price,chilled cooling, timely delivery,one can by without any doubt.Thanks to amazon","I just had it installed and so far I'm pretty happy with it. Service was surprisingly prompt as it got installed the same day that it arrived, which I have never experienced before with white goods. Cooling is good too.","I ordered 1.5ton split AC, I got the same product. When I compare it with my old 1.5 ton split ac it looks like 1 ton ac. Confused. Otherwise no problem.",4,1,5,1,3.0,1.0,1.0

I called Amazon customer care to find out and they didn't know either. So they gave me Bangalore customer care number (08039404040). I called Bangalore customer care and they gave me 2 more numbers to call (08041311700 and 9538887766) to figure out the details. I called both numbers repeatedly for an entire day and finally managed to get a reception from one number (9538887766). The lady who picked up asked me how i got her number. After i told her that i got it from Hyundai customer care and the reason for my call she gave me another number (7090268888) to call and find out the condenser and connecting pipe material details. The number she gave was giving out this message ""permanently barred all incoming calls"". So i called her back to tell her that the number wasn't helpful but as expected no response for the rest of the day. I even texted her that the number was no good.Now imagine their quality of customer service even before i buy the product. None of the people involved in the sales (Amazon) or service know what the product is made of and they want customers to buy their products.","Hai buyers. Hyundai 3star split AC model mostly condenser made in aluminum  , no doubt about it it's not a copperr condenser,  its economically product.

So nobody can beat this on price. In fac I could have bought 2 of these for similarly speced AC from any other brand. Its got a 3 star rating and for Copper tube too. So all in all a great buy. You have to pay additional 2200/- for installation though. (1440 installation + 14% service tax+750 for brackets). Additional 1500/- for core cutter to cut a hole in your wall / concrete beam. So add about 3700/- additional cost to your price. This will be the case in most cases though.So basically a best buy wrt price and this works great for us since we dont need to use this much except for very hot days in the summer.","This is the first time I have seen or heard about this brand, but anyways ordered it as it was on attractive deal.But have to say i dont regret my decision, the ac cool really fast and cooling is also upto the mark plus the outdoor unit is really silent even using on turbo mode.only thing didn't like is the remote, the display is quite dull, so sometimes becomes really difficult to read from the remote's screen. But thats a very minor issue.The installation took on the 5th day after the delivery of the product that too after couple of followups (thus a 4 stars else would have voted 5 stars)so after sale service doesn't look impressiveThe installation cost me around 1400/- bucks, as i didn't needed any extra wiring or the brackets for the ac.Installation guys were very polite to my questions.But didn't got any receipt for the installation charges which was shocking, on asking they said the company didn't provides any receipts for installation charges.. which is very unusual and seems like a malpractice from companies side, as no receipt  means they wont be paying any taxes on income generated through installation..",We got the ACs fitted from our own AC service guy! Was probably cheaper.The ACs look very smart and the cooling is great. There is no noise when the AC is running. Very pleased with the product.,"The AC was delivered and installed on time.Has been working fine for last 4 months.I held back one star, as the delivery and installation took a bit longer than expected ( longer than usual prompt Amazon delivery) when it was really hot.",Superb ac.....

I am breaking down my review in parts :1.  deliverymy seller was cloudtail which is a trusted seller according to my experiences. However, they didn't provide 1 day or 2 day delivery option even though I stay in Delhi.  The delivery took 4 days.  their delivery staff helped me in carrying the ac components till the 4th floor. Great.2. Installation.  I called for an LG technician that day and the installation happened later in the evening. it took an hour.  charges 1900 which includes, outer mounting stand rs600, 2 metre extra wire for stabilizer as I mounted on top rs 160 and rest amount is installation charges. anyway, they were LG technicians and I got a reciept for the work.3. Cooling factor : considering my room size which is more than 10 x 11 ft, plus a kitchen and a corridor, the ac cools fast.  I don't use the Himalaya cooling, but just set the thermoset to 27-26 c which efficiently cools.4. Bills. my usage maybe 4-6 hours on an average.  the ac gives me an extra bill of 600 rs (bses Delhi rate)  which I ld say, is quite negligible considering the peace of mind you get amidst the soaring temperatures.5.Maintenance. till now I regularly clean the air filter as per the user manual. and I can say all is good.6.stabilizer. I got it from snapdeal, v guard 400 voltage for 1583 rs. local market they were not willing to go below rs 2000.7. total cost ac 24400 + installation 1900 + stab 1583 = 27883","LG Team,We received a defective LG LSA3NP5A L-Nova Plus Split AC (1 Ton, 5 Star Rating, White) product purchased thru Amazon. After spending on the installation & wasting 4 hrs of time, it turned out to be in Non-Working condition. As per the service engineer No output to AC is working, needs a part replacement. Moreover he isn't sure which part & by when it will be sent. Absolutely No Accountability & Ownership from LG representatives. It takes several calls to get to the Reps & online complaint system is worst (Can't log complain online).I would rather ask for a New Product Replacement or total REFUND. Such a disappointing experience with our first LG product. Looking forward for a quick reSolution asap.","Looking good, working good & I love it.But ln side unit shows  only 3 star instead of 5...Please explain me why","Its an amazing product. Amazon did a fantastic job of following up with LG for installation, LG it self was pretty pathetic with it. I has to register for installation multiple times. Once you get the service guy at your home things get smoother. The installation guys were very professional, they did a good job. The AC is a true five star from electrical consumption point of view. With a average run of 12 hours per day the additional bill was around 800 Rs which is very economical. The night mode with auto temperature increment is a very useful feature. The controls are easy to use. I wish the remote had light in it, that would have made it easy to operate in the night, it not a big hindrance. The economy mode is very useful, and I use that all the time. Remember to always buy a voltage stabilizer with it. All in all a very good buy.","Thanks Amazon for the good deal, I got the product at 24600 with promotion + 10% hdfc cash back. Also following up with lg for getting it installed. I bought the outdoor stand and v Guard separately ( 800+1800). Installation cost around 1750","Its good . So far.but cooling doesn't stay for long after turning it off.. I would request you to improve your customer service in LG as they say stupid things on calls like they say"" I have to pay to the technician as much as he is asking over and above the installation charges"" I mean isn't there a rate card for company like LG.","The AC is really awesome. Although the time taken to cool the room is little high, might be my room is little large. But I sleep right below the AC, so I get cool air immediately. Overall the AC is serving the purpose very well. I used an average of 10hrs a day for 15 days at 28 degrees. I got an increase of just 200rs in my power bill. That's really surprising!",Good product & 5star service from Amazon... But third class service from LG.,18,4,22,6,3.0,0.0,0.0

Before installation this scene what after that?? certainly thinking of returning the product. You think before you buy LG product","The buying was smooth, the installation was smooth and now the post purchase service also has been smooth.I really appreciate the assistance of Amazon and LG.It has endured the extreme heat of north india.its working fine.i love dat it is pretty compact.When the compressor starts thrs a minor sound problem.we also had minor problem with the flaps.It was fixed properly.Its a good buy...worth searching for a deal for dis!","The product is 4 stars but 2 stars deducted for a horrible installation process. Initially, the installation was botched up. Nobody from the dealer wanted to come till Amazon people intervened. Finally, it was done after some time. Total time taken to install was a world record 10 hours.I am still in shock and awe.","I have used this AC just during 2 Summers and third summer it's gone in to dust.Its condenser gone,It has water spraying issue a manufacturer in defect.Their customer services through their outsourced ASP called COMFORT Zone just sucks.They are bunch of thugs waiting to charge you exorbitantly high services charge.Once taken money they just vanish and never attend your calls if problem persists. I would have given Negative stars..",Value for money product in this price range. Delivery was prompt as per agreed date. LG representatives came and installed the AC. Neat and decent job of installation was done. Overall happy with the service.,Delivery and product is good bt the servicing n installation is poor......expect atleast 5k to 10k extra for installation depending upon the copper wire used extra.,Worst a.c and worst experience with this a.c .

Cloudtail delivered the item along with invoice. Lg installation was quick at trivandrum. Installed on the very next day. Installation charges was 1500 plus tax..nearly 1725/-. Along with this u require a stabilizer. i ordered a vg 400 plus from V-Guard. If you dont have a ac power port,get it installed before lg installation. If u have a sunshade nearby..those clamps are not necessary. Ac chils my 180sqft room within few minutes. Along with this u get 2 free service. each at 6 month intervals provided by lg. for those who plan to buy in some metro and bring it their hometown, most of the volvo buses dont allow it as a luggage and even if they  do..they are not ready to cross interstate borders. i somehow managed to take it along and drop me b4 state border. As far as ac is concerned, its a simple model which beautifully serves d purpose. One con is that there is no horizontal swing.","I am using this product since more than 1 month. I am really happy with LG brand for AC in budget price. I am also using other brand AC and feel that now LG service is quick, better and improved. Only negative point is that this model does not has horizontal swing, Only 2 way swing is available. I think it is value for money.","During the sale of the product, I  took almost 1 hour to book this product due to non-availability and the LG service is not great. required a lot of follow-up and they are clear on the charges of installation.",cools the room well and is very silent in doing so. thumbs up for this one.,AC gives you super chill within minutes. Already using Whirlpool and Godrej. This is the best when compared to those. Godrej give you same cooling but always there are water leaks inside the room. This LG model is best. I strongly recommend this.,"good product however LG services are not up to the mark, I got this product installed in UP and company has sent inexperienced people to install the product, they damaged the gas pipeline, post that when i escalated the senior people got involved and got the product repaired.......though tehy were very helpful but i have to manage with the repaired product from day 1, company should avoid these type of instances.","The AC arrived in time. The installation was smooth , but I thought bit expensive. Amazon should review it.The performance is good.Net, very professional",18,4,22,6,2.0,1.0,0.0

I went for this AC as it was very reasonably priced in 1.5T/5* segment.Cooling is very effective. The AC has power saving mode and sleep mode to save power. Power consumption is some 1400+ W and sales people claim that power consumption is lower than the 2015 model. I have been using it for a short while, so need to observe it more to say about power consumption.It also has a dehumidifier mode to fight humid weather and keep you cool.Mosquito repellant is a novel feature. As advertised, it emits ultrasonic waves to repell mosquitoes. But given the harsh summer, there are no mosquitoes around. So didn't get to test this feature.Noise levels are quite low. LG recommends installation on wall/wooden grill to reduce noise.Overall its a decent AC for the price.","Very bad AC, consume high power with less effective cooling (in a small room)",,,,,,,18,4,22,6,0.0,2.0,0.0

This product does not come with electrical wire to connect the indoor and outdoor units. Better to buy this is advance as LG engineers overcharge for everything.4. This product does not come with extra drain pipe. Better to buy this is advance as LG engineers overcharge for everything.5. If you have a concrete wall and it does not have a hole then LG engineers will charge upto Rs. 2500 for core cutting.6. You will also need to buy a stabilizer. I bought V-Guard VG400 for Rs. 1500. This model does not come with plug so you will need to buy that as well.7. You will also need to buy mounting brackets for outdoor unit. I purchase Jenefas-Heavy Duty Wall Mount for Rs. 725.

It is working fine. Quick delivery by the vendor. Nice,"I have got good deal from Amezon. Received delivery in 3 days.

Compressor and ODU do look very capable of handling heavy heat loads.Cons :- Extremely short air throw because of poor vent design on the IDU (Indoor unit). Company claims of 20 ft air throw have the typical *conditions apply :->> 20 ft is only the diagonal distance, not the actual floor distance (which will be roughly around 17 ft?).>> IDU has to be placed at 10 ft or higher up on the wall to actually manage the 20 ft air throw.>> Has to be run in 'Jet Cool' mode (high energy consumption mode, and will run for only 30 mins).Even with all these conditions, the actual volume of air at distances greater than 8 ft is pathetic. LG Technicians tested and found 1000 CFM (!!) of air being generated at the air vents. But the air beyond 8 ft can barely cause a flutter in newspapers.Technicians eventually revealed that the IDU was designed based on feedback from consumers who wanted the unit installed in bedrooms above their beds directly cooling their bed area. Assuming a generous king sized bed size of 7 x 7 ft - it's no wonder there is no air beyond 8 ft!Bottom line - this 2 Ton AC's immense potential has been wasted, since it was designed to cool a tiny area the size of a bed!",GOOD,,,,,,,18,4,22,6,1.0,0.0,0.0

After you buy an air-conditioner, the company ceases to exist for you.They dont give service during warranty. My 5 star 1.5 ton split AC and two 1 ton 3 star ACs, all bought last year, were non functional for better part of the year. At the end of the warranty period, they have stopped giving AMCs.Emails, calls, complaints on google+, facebook, twitter, blogs etc. elicited no response.Complaints to highest functionaries and even complaints to their global website did not produce any response except that your complaint is forwarded to concerned department.",,,,,,,,18,4,22,6,0.0,0.0,0.0

The assembling cost a little high but that is applicable with any other AC. Its just the first year and I am hopeful it works fine for the coming years also. The only problem comes that LLOYD doesn't accept the sale made by Amazon since it is not its authorized dealer. So after purchase you have to tell lloyd customer care the name of the dealer not the amazon then they install it. so far so good.,,,,,,,,1,5,0,1,0.0,0.0,0.0

Some pros and consPros1. Super silent operation of indoor unit2. Super fast cooling in fact the outdoor unit of this product is as big as my 1.5 ton Onida Ac3. Cost benefit analysis of this product is 9/104. Remote controller has light :p5. 100% copper6. Customer care service is really good in Delhi .Cons1. No horizontal swing2. Follow me option is pretty useless and does not work properly- just marketing gimmick3. Midea does not give drainage pipe4. Installation. The call centre people label installation guys as engineers but trust me they r in no way comparable to actual engineer. In my case Midea and carrier does not provide installation themselves(in Delhi) but rather they rely on jeevans( same practise as flikart adopts). These guys did not even know how to break small hole in window glass(they were very young). They cracked my whole glass. They possessed tool but were not experienced to use them.Overall it's a nice product better than other Indian brands and their pathethic service","Amazon delivered the product (BANGALORE) after 10 days from actual order date.Purchase Date: 17-Apr-2016Deliver Date: 28-Apr-2016Installation: I was literally shuttling between Amazon - Midea - Account Manager - Branch Manager - Call Coordinator - Technician - Supervisor.All of them are Big time liar, they will not tell you what is your queue/wait time for installation instead giving all false statement.And finally after lots of followup between above team, finally instllation was done on 12-May-2016.Carrier/Midea do not have their own support base in Bangalore instead they depend on Aurora Cooling Solutions who does the installation for many different AC company.Finally AC looks great, performance is also good, but it is too early to evaluate and giving any proper review as this is a new product in the market from Carrier/Midea.","very good ac. this is our second unit after using the 1st one for over a year, as per the info we have, Midea supplies 90% mfg with parts and have launched their own products with partnerships with Carrier in India,service and support is from Carrier, which is very good. chills quickly / silent/good design / minimal features which result in simpler operations. would recommend this.",I raised a request with Midea customer support on 13- Aug for installation.

It is almost a month that ispite of making payment, the ac has not been delivered.i do not think a brand like this should be so unprofessional. i never wanted a mitsubishi a.c installed at the first place but fell for the dealer's words. now i have been made to pay a severe price.","I had bought this from the local dealer at Hyderabad in March 2016, not from Amazon.

Installation service was very bad. Very rude and unprofessional person came to install. Rates he quoted and from company differed. I think it was arranged by Amazon through distributor. They charge 3 times for raw material then usual market rate. Paid 6k. No bill for installation. OGeneral says no bill be provided. Fishy.If it was not brand name and credibility for years, I would have never gone for this.","Worst service, got repair after a year... too expensive for component. Got repair after a year..

It coll my 120 sqft room very efficiently. Outdoor unit also doesn't make any noise.But keep in mind that O General doesn't provide any accessories like copper gas pipe, electrical wire & water pipe. You need to pay @250 for Copper pipe (minimum of 10 ft.), @45 for electrical wire, @30 for water pipe. Always ask the installer what would be the total cost of installation. In my case installation was free but I was charged of Rs. 5990 for the above mentioned accessories, how ever I installed the indoor & outdoor unit back to back my bedroom wall. So don't doubt about the product quality but be aware of the installation cost.Also I faced a lot of trouble with the installer. At first my outdoor unit was not working. The installer installed my AC without any proper equipment & asked me to change the entire wiring & I did the same. But then it was found that the outdoor unit is faulty. O General changed my unit within 7 days. Another installer came from O General & installed the unit with proper equipment & said that I should not change the previous wiring.SO PLEASE CHECK WHETHER YOUR INSTALLER HAS COME FROM O GENERAL OR HE IS A LOCAL AC MECHANIC.","I got it off a local dealer for 37k with installation inc copper piping, v-guard stabiliser, wiring and wall brackets.It cools my room (150 sft) in about 30 to 40 min. I thought about other brands but O General is O General.I like the looks plain and simple in white. Consumption is about a unit per hour - if put in auto mode it turns off when the desired temp is reached and turns back on when it goes up. You can set it to sleep or set the timer to turn it off and turn back on too.It is super quite in quite mode but not as chilly as it is at high speed which is a little buzzy but ok I guess.The only drawback is that the remote is not backlit. And horizontal swing is only available in 1.5 ton so you have to adjust it manually.",,,,,,,2,3,2,1,0.0,0.0,0.0

Proud owner of this model from last 3 years and not even a single time i felt going back to brands Hitachi (which has worst after sales service) and Voltas(worst cooling even from 2nd year).Got 8-10 ACs changed at my home with this model of O General.Just mind three things while looking for AC - manufacturing year, cooling capacity and good stabilizer.As Gas gets down in compressor every year if ACs are kept idle (not used) for long so keep them running, get them serviced regularly before season and use them as much.Advice:- Look for cooling capacity and not for Stars. This is just a market strategy where AC works like charm for 1-2 years at 5 star electricity saving but gets down to 1 star and that too with very low cooling and that's logical (since they've been made to save electricity).After 2 year you would feel that you wasted money and then companies would ask you to get it changed.One thing more, don't get into round robin state of getting gas refilled since it may work for 1 season or at max 2(that i really doubt) but chances of compressors getting damage increases a lot.Also always go for main stream  ton as you will find lot many options in it and always get 0.5 ton higher if your room is a bit big.Feel free to ask queries but i would be able to answer queries on weekends only...",,,,,,,,2,3,2,1,1.0,0.0,0.0

Excellent model.The couple of drawbacks are the fan swing is not complete.. It just rotates around 10- 15 deg.. If you have fitted your AC behind your cot then the cool air will reach after 3 - 4ft only. I expect the swing to be compete.Another drawback is the noise.. I tried auto mode which is horrible.. The AC runs for sometime and then cuts off.. After few mins the compressor runs and blows the cool air at max fan speed.. This will disturb the sleep for sure.. Also if I keep the AC at fan speed 1 then also the noise level is high.. I brought the AC from reliance digital and  have complained too. The service person complains on the model. I called  Panasonic and they say as the model is brought from Reliance, they r not going to service. I donno what to do.",Please donot buy Panasonic A/C ..you will regret.gas leakage within the 1st six months of usage.total waste of money...:(,"I am using same ac.

I bought this from Reliance Digital and the service was amazing, product was installed in a day with no fuzzes. At 25 C it could shiver you with a powerful blower at the lowest fan speed.","Review of  Panasonic CS-UC18RKY3-4 1.5 T Split ACThe actual model number which I bought from a Reliance Digital Store is CS-UC18RKY3-4, which I understand has a nice floral design on the main indoor unit. I am not sure if there are any other differences from the one listed here on Amazon India.Regarding the performance of the AC, I must say I am more than happy to have decided to go for a Panasonic AC. I am sorry to hear about the negative reviews from other buyers, but the unit I got from Reliance is top notch and there is hardly any sound audible. The cooling is extremely good and I was shivering even when the remote was set at 26 degrees.The outdoor unit was a little larger than the ones from other brands. This one bore a shiny metallic finish which made it stand apart from other outdoor units (mostly white) in my apartment.The only drawback is that I had to purchase extra electric wiring (~ 1 metre), water drain pipe (~ 2 metres) and a 16A 3 Pin -Top for the Stabilizer during the installation process. The installation was done 4 days after the date of purchase. BTW, Reliance offered Free standard installation and Voltage Stabilizer along with the purchase of an AC. :-)Panasonic India is providing 3 free services in the first year. This will include, among other things, gas refill if needed.Overall, I am happy with the purchase. The summers in Bangalore are getting hotter year after year and an AC seems to be a necessity now rather than a luxury.",,,,,,,3,3,5,1,1.0,0.0,1.0

Cooling is good even on hot days with 45 degress temperature. The AC is effecitive in a short while. It also comes with a sleep timer and remote range is good even in a big room.Few drawbacks.1) No light on remote so it becomes difficult to operate it at night2) The blue lights on AC panel emit a lot of light. The room gets a lot of visibility at night.,Zero starExtremely poor after sales service.  My ac developed a snag and it was difficult to get it fine. Even servicing nobody is interested in it. So better not to buy any such product,,,,,,,3,3,5,1,1.0,0.0,0.0

I bought two of these ACs after a lot of research. The AC has a copper condenser. Doing my math on the 2014 Energy charges i figured a 2 star was a better buy than a 3 star considering my 5 hours of use during 5 months of heat vs the price difference and assuming a life of 5 years. Also has compared with Inverter ACs from Sharp. Again the cost did not justify the electricity savings. Its been a year of use and am satisfied with the performance. I had received free installation for the ACs. I think my electricity bill went up by 750 bucks per ac per month.Probably as per the new BEE 2015 standards this AC might become one star. I would recommend this AC for 24000 with free installation.,,,,,,,,3,3,5,1,0.0,0.0,0.0

No shortage of calls from Customer Satisfaction Team.Fun is that with out clearing complaints getting SMS confirmation stating that Complaints have been cleared.Reason may be that it is a worst product and beyond repair.

But this is not normal, so I suspected the issue must be with the filter and found that it doesn't seal properly and he acknowledge that, but he said this should be informed within 1 month of purchase for warranty.Illogical Policy: The unit causes trouble after few months of usage which leads to the finding of filter issue, how do I know this in advance within 1 month to claim warranty.My Service Experience: The service guy struggled 2 hours to disassemble, but cleaned easily and struggled to assemble and gave up, he called for help and another guy came, he handled bit harsh on the plastics, but he succeeded assembling it and but unit doesn't power up. he again disassembled and started complaining about a connector which is loose, the other guy said the unit is under warranty, he stopped complaining and fixed it. I said the connector must be damaged while disassembling, might cause issues later, but he refused.

When I decided to buy another one for children's room, I chose Sharp again since it looked a good product. However, the new inverter ac stopped working after a month. I raised a complaint and have been waiting for a resolution for more than 2 weeks now. I understand that Sharp does not have a solid process in place for customer support. They have outsourced the support functions to some small timers and you are at the mercy of these folks - they may or may not attend your complaint. I have called them at least 10 times. Warranty does not mean anything as the only thing Sharp does is give you a phone number of the outsourced support partner. As opposed to Sharp, Voltas and Daikin have a strong customer support process in place and hence my advise is to check the customer support availability at your location before you buy a Sharp product.

Bought this myself (243cya) in Delhi(not through amazon) and repenting until now. It was installed on 25 April and did not function . Installation technicians confirmed a minor fault and that it would be repaired in a few days. After complaining to voltas a technician came after 3 days and could not fix the brand new unit. He confirmed a manufacturing defect in the indoor unit. Complained to voltas again and requested them replace the defective piece. Despite repeated complaints to voltas, second technician visited on 27 May ( 32 days after installation) and again wrote manufacturing fault on indoor as well as outdoor unit also this time which was tested then. Have spoken to /requested voltas cc and their regional head in Delhi to please make a solution but till date this unit is a show piece in my living room. They don't even have the courtesy to reply or acknowledge the complaint email sent to their email address (with attached service report confirming a manufacturing defect in the brand new piece) ...Despite repeated requests customer care outrightly refuse to provide any contact details of higher up/senior voltas officials.

The installation was quick and clean by Voltas just after few days of purchase from Amazon. Though it may be because I stay in Mumbai where service is usually good.Initially I was bit worried about AC's 3 star rating, but as it turns out, electricity bill was less than expected and it is quite acceptable when I compare it with my other room's 5 Star rated Voltas AC(which is 1.5 ton).There is no display on the remote but it doesn't feel cheap. The body of IDU and ODU feels nice and sturdy and both units are surprisingly silent.So far I am impressed with this Voltas AC, and I might update this review again after 1 year just to confirm if its performance remains same or has deteriorated.","Voltas service is bad and unresponsive. They keep on sending messages about appointment for installation. No one turns up. After about ten days they turned up and took 7 hours to install. In order to shift a tube light, the installation guy demanded money. Finally they installed in a way that I could not open my window. In complaining voltas promptly sent some one to repair and rectify.  However I was stressed by daily follow up with voltas. It seems they give priority to installing ac's bought from offline retailers for whom installation is free as well.Now for the AC, I got it an incredible lightning price! (123lyb) AC for the price I paid is OK. No evidence of excess sound as some people are complaining. By the way there is difference in specifications between 123 lyi and lyb ( lyibis better with gold fins etc) All in all happy with the value proposition provided by AC, very unhappy with the voltas customer service. 4/5 for AC. 0/5 for voltas service.  Overall 2/5. If you buy, register a request with voltas on the day you order.","pathetic AC I have purchased 2 and its not cooling at all even after 2 to 3 hrs of operation raised a complaint with voltas they came and this is what heyhave to say...""THEY ALSO WENT ON TO SAY THAT IF IT WAS A FIRST TIME CUSTOMER YOU WOULDNT KNOW ONLY COS I HAVE USED A BETTER PRODUCT I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE. AND THIS VOLTAS AC CANNOT BE COMPARED TO BLUE STAR OR MITSIBISHI AC's."" SAD SAD SAD...never buy a voltas product",The product is good but somehow face issues with installation as the persons came from voltas were not well equipped and  trained.The installation was not upto the mark & i called them again to fix the issues.Otherwise product is good,There is a loud noise from the AC from the day after installation. Feel regret for investing on this.,Using it for last one year. No such noise as being mentioned in other reviews. Good product.,Same problem.  Loud noise from day 1,Good product. As described in the specifications.Inner unit's noise is negligible but outer unit produces noise.,16,24,24,25,1.0,1.0,4.0

But the lightning sale was just too tempting, and i figured 'how bad can it really be?"" Bad decision. It's been pure and simple horrible! Its been 15 days since the purchase and i have not been able to use the AC even once. The first guy who came for the installation apparently left too much gas, causing ice formation in the indoor unit, which hence had to be kept switched off. 3 days later, someone came to resolve it, removed gas, and in the process not only made the AC completely non effective, but also broke the swing making it impossible for the flap to close. the call center rep assured me that he would get it checked on priority - but actually didn't note the problem at all! i just called up to ask the status of my complaint and have been pushed back a further 3 working days for resolution. Considering i've spent almost 40k of my hard earned cash on this piece of junk, i now wish i had gone with a tried and trusted brand instead. There is no escalation matrix, call center doesn't have a TL available for a chat, there are no mail ids to call, service center doesn't entertain calls - all you are left with is an ineffective call center rep, a text box to vent your frustrations online, and a broken AC. Hope you are stronger willed than I was - there are no free / discounted lunches, and if something is being sold at a heavy discount, it is quite likely that there is some problem with it.",Wish there was a negative star rating too. This is the first time I ordered the AC for my room. Was pretty excited before I got the clear picture. In the description it has been mentioned that they would be providing a Copper tube grove but the compressor which came has an Aluminium tube! The description mentioned by Amazon is absolutely deceiving. For the service provided by Voltas all that i can say is... its Awful!...  The worst service ever! An engineer was supposed to contact me in 24 hours for installation but there was no response for 3 days!... Absolutely unsatisfied with  the product and service provided  by Amazon and Voltas both!,Please do not buy... Amazon is misguiding customers by writing incorrect product description.Installation is not included. Voltas charges Rs 1500 for a very inefficient and untidy installation.Amazon mentions the product comes with a copper tube/compressor but the product comes with all aluminium which is a huge cost factor. Copper tube/compressors are always more durable and expensive than aluminium ones.,"I am fed up with Voltas guys as they are not coming for installing the product. Everyday I kept on calling them.  And they claim that warranty will be void if I get it installed through other technicians.In addition, the local stores are offering free installation with stabilizer free.After waiting for 8 days, I returned this product. I am frustrated by the way Voltas people answer. The worst customer care and worst service.","This is one of the best buys Ive ever made!This a/c looks so sleek,is silent and cools very soon.It barely takes any time at all to cool the entire room+closed balcony!Definitely recommended to everyone,I love it!","No issues so far. Delivery was prompt by Amazon (within 3 days - that was awesome!) Been a couple of weeks since installation & the machine seems to be working fine. Installation was prompt. Infact there was a same day offer by Voltas to install. All in all, a good buy.","After reading many reviews on various portals i was sceptical to buy online due to mainly installation issues, faulty product issues.My experience has been as followsAmazon - Phenominal service, great tracking, spot on delivery, good packaging and very friendly customer service. Full marks thereAC - installation couldn't have been smoother, i called up the helpline and they followed up with me and got the product installed the very next day. The technician was skilled. The product works just fine and looks great too.I  bought this AC in Mumbai..this cools super fast, is very stylish and  absolute value for money.Lastly - this is not a paid review....i am a genuine buyer of this product.","Wrong installation, have left drainage pipe open in my room. Already, costed Rs.5800/- for the installation and who knows how much else we have to spent. Made room so dirt, didn't even bother to clean anything. I have photos as proof proof for all this. But, Amazon delivery has no problems. Worst kind of service from Voltas.

Unfortunately when you buy an AC you must also get the thing fitted before you can use it. That is where Voltas SUCKS! Nobody called us for 5 days after the delivery for installation. When we called them repeatedly and threatened to return the AC, they grudgingly came by for installation. The guys who came told my mother that they'd have to cut the windows in order to install it (mind you, this is a split AC)!! When I told them that that's not acceptable and we'd return the AC, they said go ahead and left happily :D. I was able to get external help to get it fitted correctly without any structural changes and the product itself works great.Buyer Beware: If you buy this product, add about Rs. 3,500 to your budget as installation cost.","After lots of search I bought this item. Comparison was with LG and then I did choose this product Voltas as it comes with 'Copper tube' .As of now It cool the room pretty fast and not much sound from the fan.

Thus the compressor does not work and there is no cooling.I have called Voltas customer care several times and I have still not received a call from their technician.This is the second time I am writing this review.

If this review is not posted I will post a review in the news papers. I am a journalist and can tell the world how I have received a product that does not work, no customer service, and been insulted by my honest review being rejected for its content. This means Amazon only posts good reviews and bad ones are hidden to trick customers into buying!!! I'm sure people would like to read my review on a public consumer Forum as Amazon refuses to publish it!!!","Superb AC! I'm glad to have bought this. My model is DYe which is an upgrade of this model. I got the DYe model when I ordered this DY model. So you may also receive what I got. It's quite powerful and cools our large bedroom instantly and efficiently. To my knowledge this is the most efficient 2 Ton AC in the market (at the time of writing). I couldn't find any 2 Ton AC consuming less than 1741 watts (1774 watts is for DY model). It has all the features a good AC should. There are advanced and sophisticated models from Hitachi. However with more sophistication comes the difficulty to service or repair the unit. There is still shortage of qualified technicians. Personally I would wait a few more years before adopting such advanced models in order to avoid the headaches of after sales service.My experience with the Voltas service was a good one. These guys installed the unit on the day I received it. I had some issues after the installation which was also resolved to my satisfaction. I still look forward to experiencing the professionalism shown in developed countries. The Indian service simply lack that. Anyway the service aspect was one of the main reasons to opt a Voltas product.You will have to buy a wall mount separately for the ODU. You will also need to buy a 15 Amp stabilizer to handle voltage fluctuations. Besides this the technician may ask you to get 500 g of white cement to seal the opening of the wall. An installation charge of Rs. 1,500 + Rs. 350 (Installing the Wall Mount) will also be charged. Well these are the additional costs you will incur along with this unit. These installation charges may vary depending on your location.In all this is an powerful AC capable of cooling large rooms including showrooms!","Product is fine and as described and the delivery was timely. However, EasyHome's shipment needs improvement - 1 of the locks (used to hang on the wall metal frame) was broken on arrival - I have attached the broken lock and normal locks photos, pls see. Installation team was good enough to organize it in a couple of days ELSE I would have to deal with replacement process with Amazon/ EasyHome, which would have taken longer.

I have been buying small items ( mobile fones , clothes , pens etc ) with good products and service by Amazon every time. However , this time the experience was worse.After the AC was delivered the technician from Voltas called up to ask for installation and we told him to come right away. I rechecked with the website where it is mentioned that the charges for installation can range between 300-1500 Rs. The technician after inspecting the AC quoted an amount of 3200 by saying all kinds of non sense "" extra "" things. More so , he used filthy language when we told him that the website has actually quoted the price range for the installation . I did not expect this kind of behaviour from a Voltas employee. We refused to get the installation done by this AC technician and have lodged a complaint with Voltas too. We requested a private AC installer who did the job for 1200 rs. The technician even threatened us that if we get the job done from any other company then we will loose the warranty. We would soon be lodging a complaint with Consumer Court also.Over all , a lot of waste of time and effort for a small thing like installation of AC.

Easy to operate4. Reasonably pricedCons:1. Has aluminium condenser (and not copper), but the cooling is amazing so that is sorted. Secondly voltas uses some blue technology to avoid rusting so the major two drawbacks of aluminium condenser are taken care off2.

Complaint have been registered from last two month but no one from Voltas visited to resolve the complaint. I have called more than 30 times to customer care but no results . Now I am tired so I decided to write here.,The Voltas service centre is the worst possible outfit. They refuse to register the product for warranty. Have tried through email with no response.

But the lightning sale was just too tempting, and i figured 'how bad can it really be?"" Bad decision. It's been pure and simple horrible! Its been 15 days since the purchase and i have not been able to use the AC even once. The first guy who came for the installation apparently left too much gas, causing ice formation in the indoor unit, which hence had to be kept switched off. 3 days later, someone came to resolve it, removed gas, and in the process not only made the AC completely non effective, but also broke the swing making it impossible for the flap to close. the call center rep assured me that he would get it checked on priority - but actually didn't note the problem at all! i just called up to ask the status of my complaint and have been pushed back a further 3 working days for resolution. Considering i've spent almost 40k of my hard earned cash on this piece of junk, i now wish i had gone with a tried and trusted brand instead. There is no escalation matrix, call center doesn't have a TL available for a chat, there are no mail ids to call, service center doesn't entertain calls - all you are left with is an ineffective call center rep, a text box to vent your frustrations online, and a broken AC. Hope you are stronger willed than I was - there are no free / discounted lunches, and if something is being sold at a heavy discount, it is quite likely that there is some problem with it.",Wish there was a negative star rating too. This is the first time I ordered the AC for my room. Was pretty excited before I got the clear picture. In the description it has been mentioned that they would be providing a Copper tube grove but the compressor which came has an Aluminium tube! The description mentioned by Amazon is absolutely deceiving. For the service provided by Voltas all that i can say is... its Awful!...  The worst service ever! An engineer was supposed to contact me in 24 hours for installation but there was no response for 3 days!... Absolutely unsatisfied with  the product and service provided  by Amazon and Voltas both!,Please do not buy... Amazon is misguiding customers by writing incorrect product description.Installation is not included. Voltas charges Rs 1500 for a very inefficient and untidy installation.Amazon mentions the product comes with a copper tube/compressor but the product comes with all aluminium which is a huge cost factor. Copper tube/compressors are always more durable and expensive than aluminium ones.,"I am fed up with Voltas guys as they are not coming for installing the product. Everyday I kept on calling them.  And they claim that warranty will be void if I get it installed through other technicians.In addition, the local stores are offering free installation with stabilizer free.After waiting for 8 days, I returned this product. I am frustrated by the way Voltas people answer. The worst customer care and worst service.","This is one of the best buys Ive ever made!This a/c looks so sleek,is silent and cools very soon.It barely takes any time at all to cool the entire room+closed balcony!Definitely recommended to everyone,I love it!","No issues so far. Delivery was prompt by Amazon (within 3 days - that was awesome!) Been a couple of weeks since installation & the machine seems to be working fine. Installation was prompt. Infact there was a same day offer by Voltas to install. All in all, a good buy.","After reading many reviews on various portals i was sceptical to buy online due to mainly installation issues, faulty product issues.My experience has been as followsAmazon - Phenominal service, great tracking, spot on delivery, good packaging and very friendly customer service. Full marks thereAC - installation couldn't have been smoother, i called up the helpline and they followed up with me and got the product installed the very next day. The technician was skilled. The product works just fine and looks great too.I  bought this AC in Mumbai..this cools super fast, is very stylish and  absolute value for money.Lastly - this is not a paid review....i am a genuine buyer of this product.","Wrong installation, have left drainage pipe open in my room. Already, costed Rs.5800/- for the installation and who knows how much else we have to spent. Made room so dirt, didn't even bother to clean anything. I have photos as proof proof for all this.

I am attaching the photos also.,"I did a lot of research to find out the difference between 185CY and 185JY but there was hardly anything available on the net. Now that I have both the models installed at my home, let me try to summarize the difference:1) Sleep mode - In 185CY, all the lights can be switched off so it not disturb your sleep but in 185JY, you will have 1 light 'on' even in sleep mode. Worst part is  - this light starts flickering as soon as the outdoor unit shuts off. If you are sleeping in a dark room without any night lamp, this may annoy your sleep2) Looks - Aesthetically, 185JY beats 185CY hands down. It looks premium and the display is also very nice3) Features - One important feature that 185JY misses over 185CY is 'auto' fan speed. This is a very good feature in CY which increases the fan speed and helps cool faster automatically rather than you controlling the fan speed in the middle of the night. All other features seems to be same4) Sound level - I felt 185CY to be quieter than JY5) Remote - CY remote looks better than JY but this is debatableOverall, a good product from Voltas other than the flickering light!!","Nice aesthetics, good performance. But installation from Voltas is not that great. It is expensive and not satisfactory. I had researched a lot of ACs including LG and other brands, but finally settled for Voltas because of good pricing and not significant disadvantages over other ACs.",prize difference is too mch as compared to snapdealso pls fix the problem,"Quite Satisfied with this all rounder.It's been 4 months of use now and I think the AC is working perfect for my mid size room. The installation done by Voltas was quick but bit messy partly due to layout of the Room. The ODU (outdoor unit) is huge but the body of both IDU (indoor unit) and ODU feels nice and sturdy and both units are silent.IDU in particular has nice features and feels elegant.I am happy and impressed with this Voltas AC, and I might update this review again after 1 year just to confirm if its performance remains same or has deteriorated.",worst product.outdoor unit is giving huge noise after running for an hour or so. the problem begins just after technician had installed on very first day.

Wrong selling by Voltas. Pls be careful while buying offline or online.  I would say avoid Voltas products. I have other two AC by sharp and all brackets, pipes everything is covered in 1500.","AC is really awesome, my room 10x10 and it's freezing in 30 mins.

So, I have discussed with voltas service people and local AC mechanic about this product and their replay makes me unhappy. Because the life aluminium condenser is 3 years maximum and will generate small holes due to faster oxidation than copper and also it cannot be repairable.Replacement cost is Rs.10000, It is not acceptable from the grate AC manufacturer.So please mention the demerits of this product in your specification.","Delayed and vert Bad and messy installation by Voltas, product looks refurbished",Don't purchase split ac of voltas worst ac I have purchased instead go for Hitachi or Samsung they are long lasting and cooling is superb and noiseless.

I have this AC. The problem is that its metal capillaries are not adequately covered with padding and are exposed. Do to this design flaw, when the compressor switches on, the metal capillaries in a high vibrational state hit against each other creating a very disturbing sound in the middle of the night. This hitting is sporadic and does not manifest everytime the compressor switches on. It is sad that Voltas failed to adequately cover the inner capillaries. The solution is to call the neighbourhood AC repair guy and ask him to cover all the metal capillaries with foam padding and tape it properly. Secure the capillaries so that even when they vibrate at higher amplitudes and hit against each other the metal is covered and the sound is muffled. Once the AC repair guy covered the mettal capillaries with padding the capillary vibration sound decibels fell to inaudible levels. I bought this model in 2015 but not from Amazon. I wish I had bought over Amazon and returned this model back to Voltas.","In 1.5 months, a;ready repaired twice under warranty. I think Amazon sells seconds stuff",Super cool ac. Thanks to amazon for the price n fast delivery!!!!,"Product was delivered before delivery date.. I got AC Fitted from local market and it is working good so far.. things I like are cooling, low noise of compressor.. Needs to wait for some time to see how it goes but feeling good with the product till now.",...good product...on time delivery from amazon...,satisfied with the product and amazon delivery,The cooling is excellent. Just waiting for this month's bill to come. As it is 5 star rated. It must reduce the burning too. So good value for money.,"The product is received in damaged condition. Its filter cover lock is broken it was taped and i just came to know when the tape on the cover came out. Such is the kind of product sold. Installation for window AC is also not free and installation charges are also high, when i got it installed from my ac technician amazon says that manufacturer will not give warranty for this product as it is not installed by Voltas.Dont buy its a advise, or buy at your own risk",16,24,24,25,3.0,0.0,0.0

Horrible product. After paying 45 grand and buying a flagship product you would expect some decent quality. Within first 10 days AC stopped cooling and compressor started making loud noises. After I registered a complain, the technician visited my house on 3rd day (Excellent support right?). He fixed the noise in the compressor, but said he needs some more parts which he doesn't have and will be at my house next day at sharp 10 am to fix it. After spending two nights with burning walls I was hesitant to spend another but had a no choice. So the next day up to 12 noon, no one shows up and no calls. I called back asking what was the deal, and the dude says he is off to some remote location and promises he will come in the evening to fix it. Again no one shows up in the evening. I call the person again and he says he can't come. I call the local center they say, they have no one to send (the work needs only 5 mins once you have the parts - capacitor).Anyway I have been promised again it will be fixed tomorrow morning but am not very optimistic. This was the first time I bought an Voltas product and I am quite sure this is the last. Voltas, it is not only that you are providing crappy products, but your support is even worse and that too when you charge a premium price much higher then LG and samsung. If you are looking to buy this or any other Voltas product be prepared to face a lot of s***.",,,,,,,,16,24,24,25,0.0,1.0,0.0

AC mounted not by fixing screws but they use hammering screw while fitting. One of my chair also get broken while installation as they do not have helper and there ladder. They do not have proper tools for installation.It was taken 5 PM to 11:30 PM for Installation by one man army installation engineerI suggest to buy AC with free installation charges.","DON'T BUY WHIRLPOOL AC.  My compressor stopped working, it was under warrantee.  When I called Whirlpool service center, they told me they will send a technician within 24 hours.  It's been 7 days now, recomplained again but never received any calls from their technician.  Obviously, they don't want to replace the compressor.  Finally, I've gotten fed up and sold my ac at dirt cheap price. Final Impression:  Short life span, 3rd class service, 3rd class product.","The product got delivered in 5 working days, which I think is fine.I need to pay the installation charges of INR1,500 and additional INR 1500 also for the extra Copper pipe at the rate of INR 750 per meter.I was  expecting the additional installation charges , as the same was mentioned in the terms and conditions at the time of purchase, however I was not expecting that I need to pay for the extra copper pipe and that's also for that much of high rate.The room size where I have installed the AC is 11ft x 10 ft and is not exposed to sun raise because of its direction, even though the cooling capacity of the AC is not that good.It took almost half an hour to cool the room at 6th sense and when I use the turbo mode it cools fast but..it becomes a bit humid. Its to be noted that my residence is not near sea side.Overall I find it to be okay, however find the price point very reasonable.","Very good ac bought from store @32,400 cool my 10*11 room less than 10 minutes no word just amazing blindly trust brand whirlpool after all its made in u.s.a",working very nicely,,,,1,1,0,2,1.0,1.0,0.0
